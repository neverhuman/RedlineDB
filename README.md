## Install

### Rust library

Add to `Cargo.toml`. Use an exact pin for production:

```toml
[dependencies]
redlinedb = "=1.0.1"   # exact pin — recommended for production
# redlinedb = "1"      # any compatible 1.x (fine for libraries)
```

`Cargo.lock` locks the resolved version for binary crates. Run `cargo update -p redlinedb` to upgrade on your schedule.

### CLI binary — Linux & macOS

Latest release:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Pin to a specific version** (recommended for CI and reproducible environments):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB/main/scripts/install.sh | VERSION=v1.0.1 bash
```

Fully lock the download by pinning both the release tag and the tarball digest:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB/main/scripts/install.sh | \
  VERSION=v1.0.1 REDLINEDB_SHA256=<sha256> bash
```

Custom install prefix:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB/main/scripts/install.sh | \
  VERSION=v1.0.1 PREFIX=~/.local bash
```

The script requires SHA-256 verification before installing. By default it
downloads the matching `.sha256` release asset; `REDLINEDB_SHA256` lets CI
pin the exact digest inline.

### cargo install (from source, version-pinned)

```bash
cargo install redlinedb-cli --version 1.0.1 --locked
# or from a specific git tag:
cargo install --git https://github.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB.git --tag v1.0.1 --package redlinedb-cli --locked
```

`--locked` enforces the committed `Cargo.lock` — ensures you get the exact dependency tree that was tested.

### Direct download

Pre-built tarballs on the [releases page](https://github.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB/releases):

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | `redlinedb-v1.0.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `redlinedb-v1.0.1-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `redlinedb-v1.0.1-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` |

Each tarball has a matching `.sha256` checksum file and contains:
`bin/redlinedb`, `lib/libredlinedb.*`, `include/redlinedb.h`, and
`include/sqlite3.h`.

## Why RedlineDB

SQLite is the most-deployed database engine on Earth — billions of installs, decades of stability, a public-domain test corpus that runs to roughly 92.6 million lines. It is also a single-writer database. Its WAL design is brilliant for the embedded device that birthed it, and a hard ceiling for the embedded application that has since become a 64-thread service.

RedlineDB is a ground-up rewrite in safe Rust that keeps the SQLite API contract — the C ABI, the SQL surface, the embedded model — and replaces the storage core with **MVCC, a concurrent B-tree, real group-commit WAL, and a deterministic crash-recovery story.** It is tested end-to-end by a 1,728-child certification matrix on a 128-core host and a 24-case failpoint matrix that proves zero lost acked commits across every crash injection point we hook.

| | RedlineDB | SQLite |
|---|---|---|
| Active source LOC | **34,999 (100% Rust)** | ~250,000 (C) |
| Concurrency model | MVCC, multi-writer | Single-writer WAL |
| Test count | 243 passing | (separate test corpus) |
| Ecosystem compat | Rust-native API + `sqlite3_*` symbol shim (Rust FFI crate) | native C API |
| Memory safety | Safe Rust (unsafe limited to FFI boundary in `crates/ffi`) | Unsafe by language |

## Bench headlines

The headline numbers below are from the **`phase10-xbabe1-certified`** run (median of five reps per cell on **xbabe1: 128 vCPU, Linux 6.8, ext4, Docker 29.2.1, Rust 1.95.0, SQLite via rusqlite bundled**, strict durability, ~1700-child cert matrix, manifest hashed and reproducible).

| Workload | Threads | RedlineDB qps | SQLite qps | **Phase-10 Ratio** | Phase-9 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| writers-disjoint | 64 | **1,256** | 79 | **15.89×** | 8.32× |
| mixed-95/5 OLTP | 64 | **24,763** | 1,680 | **14.74×** | 7.92× |
| mixed-80/20 OLTP | 64 | **6,154** | 405 | **15.21×** | 8.01× |
| mixed-50/50 OLTP | 64 | **2,483** | 160 | **15.55×** | 7.90× |
| point-read-pk | 64 | 121,268 | 122,221 | 0.99× (parity) | 0.99× |
| point-read-pk | 32 | 32,611 | 23,371 | 1.40× | — |
| hot-row-update | 64 | 35 | 79 | 0.44× | 0.21× |
| secondary-index-range | 64 | 5,598 | 117,088 | 0.048× | 0.012× |
| secondary-index-read | 64 | 16,245 | 121,030 | 0.13× | — |

**Reading the table.** Phase 10's MVCC index format and the SQL-side index-undo removal **roughly doubled** the contended-write headlines vs phase-9: writers-disjoint goes 8.32× → **15.89×**, and the three mixed-OLTP cells move from 7.9–8.0× into the 14.7–15.6× band. The two contention-bound losses also improve (hot-row-update 0.21× → 0.44×, range scan 0.012× → 0.048×) but still trail SQLite — those are honest engineering items, not headline material. Point-read-pk at 64 threads holds parity (0.99×) where the SQLite reader path is already near-optimal.

### Throughput vs threads

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fig1_throughput_scaling.png" alt="Throughput vs threads" width="80%">
</p>

Five workloads across the full thread sweep, log-y. RedlineDB (solid) keeps climbing where SQLite (dashed) plateaus.

### Tail latency (p99) vs threads

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fig2_latency_p99.png" alt="p99 latency vs threads" width="80%">
</p>

p99 latency under load. RedlineDB's MVCC commit path keeps the 99th-percentile tail bounded as concurrency grows on read-mostly mixes; on writers-disjoint the 64-thread sweet spot is visible.

### RedlineDB / SQLite ratio per (workload, thread)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fig3_ratio_bars.png" alt="RedlineDB / SQLite ratio bars" width="80%">
</p>

Each bar is `redline_qps / sqlite_qps` at one (workload, thread) cell. Bars above the gray 1.0 line are RedlineDB wins; bars below are SQLite wins. We do not airbrush the latter.

### Scaling efficiency

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fig4_scaling_efficiency.png" alt="Scaling efficiency" width="80%">
</p>

`qps(N) / qps(1)` per workload, with the dashed line indicating ideal linear scaling. Mixed and disjoint-writer workloads track near-linear out to 64 threads; the 128-thread regression is the cross-core scaling cliff we discuss in the paper.

### Crash and failpoint certification

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fig5_recovery_failpoint.png" alt="Recovery, failpoint, compat pass counts" width="60%">
</p>

- **36 / 36** recovery-matrix cases pass (3 scenarios × 2 durabilities × 6 kill windows).
- **24 / 24** failpoint-matrix cases pass with **zero lost acked commits** — a synced-ack child oracle proves recovery republishes every commit the workload acknowledged before crash.
- **40 / 40** SQL compatibility cases pass against a sqllogictest-style suite.

The cert harness is reproducible: one CLI invocation rebuilds the Docker image, runs every cell, fetches artifacts, and hashes them into a manifest carrying the git SHA, host fingerprint, image digest, and SQLite PRAGMAs.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="RedlineDB architecture" width="95%">
</p>

RedlineDB is 100% Rust, top to bottom. The primary interface is the Rust facade (`redlinedb`) that owns the public types — `Database`, `Connection`, `Statement`, `Row`, `OpenOptions`. For compatibility testing and incremental integration, `crates/ffi` exports `extern "C"` symbols (`rldb_*` plus the documented `sqlite3_*` aliases) for the covered ABI surface; no C source code is involved. The SQL engine (`redlinedb-sql`) wraps the kernel via a parser-planner-executor pipeline. The kernel (`redlinedb-kernel`) holds the catalog, the B-tree index, the MVCC engine, the WAL coordinator, and the slotted-page storage layer. The entire codebase is safe Rust modulo the necessary `unsafe` at the FFI boundary in `crates/ffi` and a single audited thread-local in the kernel for failpoint thread-arming.

### Crate layout

| Crate | LOC (active) | What it owns |
|---|---:|---|
| [`crates/kernel`](crates/kernel) | 12,883 | Slotted-page heap, MVCC version chains, WAL coordinator, B-tree index, catalog snapshot, recovery |
| [`crates/sql`](crates/sql) | 11,615 | sqlparser-rs SQLite-dialect parser, cost-based planner, vectorized executor, per-tx index undo log |
| [`crates/redlinedb`](crates/redlinedb) | 2,975 | Public Rust facade — Database, Connection, Statement, Row, OpenOptions, BeginMode |
| [`crates/ffi`](crates/ffi) | 1,478 | Rust FFI crate: exports `rldb_*` and documented `sqlite3_*` aliases for compatibility testing |
| [`crates/bench`](crates/bench) | 5,144 | Workload harness, parallel certify scheduler, recovery-matrix, failpoint-matrix, compat suite |
| [`crates/cli`](crates/cli) | — | One-shot shell for queries, stats, backups |
| [`crates/server`](crates/server) | — | Optional framed local server |

### Key engine properties

- **MVCC + concurrent B-tree.** Tuples carry version chains tagged by CSN. The index uses physical-key navigation `(logical_key, row_id)` so duplicate-key runs split correctly, range scans terminate as soon as the next leaf's first key is past the upper bound, and concurrent writers on disjoint rows do not serialize.
- **Group-commit WAL.** A `WalCoordinator` thread batches commits and surfaces real fdatasync/pwrite counters into the bench manifest. The WAL payload includes a `CatalogSnapshot` variant so DDL is durable through crash without a separate fsync dance.
- **Per-transaction index undo log.** SQL DML drives both the heap and every catalog index. On rollback **or commit failure**, the inverse log replays so the heap and indexes never diverge — even if the kernel `commit` returns an error after physical pages have been mutated.
- **Planner-executor consistency invariant.** The planner only emits an `IndexPointLookup` or `IndexRangeScan` when the index has a live handle and a populated `meta_page_id`; a debug assertion (`access_path_is_consumable_by_executor`) prevents the planner from ever proposing an access path the executor cannot honor.
- **Bin-packing parallel benchmark scheduler.** Reserves four cores for OS plus parent overhead, dispatches as many children as fit the remaining core budget. The full cert matrix on xbabe1 finishes in ~58 wall-clock minutes vs the multi-day estimate the serial harness implied.

### Insert path

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/dataflow.png" alt="INSERT data flow" width="95%">
</p>

A single INSERT flows: `Connection.execute → Parser → Planner → Executor.execute_insert` which both writes a heap tuple and calls `BtreeIndex.insert_tx`, recording an `IndexUndoOp` for rollback. The transaction commits via `Engine.commit → WalCoordinator.append + fsync → publish CSN` — failpoints intercept every step for crash certification.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Rust toolchain | **1.95** | `rustup toolchain install 1.95` (or see `rust-toolchain.toml`) |
| cargo-nextest | 0.9.133 | `curl -LsSf https://get.nexte.st/0.9.133/linux \| tar zxf - -C ~/.cargo/bin` |
| just (task runner) | any | `cargo install just` |
| OS | Linux / macOS | Windows untested; `--with-strace` bench flag is Linux-only |

### Build and test

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB.git && cd RedlineDB

# Full test suite (928 passing, 22 ignored for known engine gaps)
cargo nextest run --workspace --locked

# The CI gate — fmt-check + workspace-check + nextest
just fast

# Audit score (85 / 85)
just score

# Supply-chain scan (cargo-audit + gitleaks)
just security
```

### Embedded use (Rust)

Add to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
redlinedb = { path = "crates/redlinedb" }
```

```rust
use redlinedb::{Database, DbOptions, SqlValue, Step};
use std::sync::Arc;

let db = Database::create("/tmp/demo.redline", DbOptions::default())?;
let conn: Arc<_> = db.connect();

conn.execute("CREATE TABLE kv(k INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, v TEXT)")?;
conn.execute("INSERT INTO kv VALUES (1, 'hello')")?;

let mut stmt = conn.prepare("SELECT v FROM kv WHERE k = 1")?;
while let Step::Row = stmt.step()? {
    println!("{:?}", stmt.column_value(0)?);
}
```

#### Thread model

| Type | Send | Sync | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Database` | ✓ | ✓ | Share across threads; hand out fresh `Connection`s |
| `Connection` | ✓ | ✗ | One per thread; move between threads if needed |
| `Statement` | ✗ | ✗ | Bound to one connection borrow; do not pool |

`Database::create_in_memory()` and `Database::create_ephemeral()` create transient shared sessions that clean up when the last handle drops. From async code, keep `Database` in shared state, open one `Connection` per blocking worker, and run synchronous SQL work inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` or an equivalent worker pool.

### Ecosystem compatibility (C ABI shim)

RedlineDB is 100% Rust, but the `crates/ffi` crate exports C-callable symbols so SQLite-linked ecosystems can exercise the documented compatibility surface where it matches their needs. No C code is involved — `crates/ffi` is a Rust crate that uses `extern "C"` + `#[no_mangle]` to produce a compatible shared library.

```c
// Existing C/C++ code links against libredlinedb instead of libsqlite3.
// The sqlite3.h shim (7 lines, just a redirect) maps sqlite3_* → rldb_*.
#include "crates/ffi/include/rldb.h"

rldb *db;
rldb_open("demo.redline", &db);

rldb_stmt *stmt;
rldb_prepare_v2(db, "SELECT k FROM kv", -1, &stmt, NULL);
while (rldb_step(stmt) == RLDB_ROW) {
    int64_t k = rldb_column_int64(stmt, 0);
}
rldb_finalize(stmt);
rldb_close(db);
```

Full `sqlite3_*` symbol coverage is a planned FFI lane. See [Limitations and roadmap](#limitations-and-roadmap).

### CLI

```bash
# One-shot query
cargo run -p redlinedb-cli --release -- exec /tmp/demo.redline "SELECT count(*) FROM kv"

# Storage stats
cargo run -p redlinedb-cli --release -- stats /tmp/demo.redline --json

# Physical backup
cargo run -p redlinedb-cli --release -- backup /tmp/demo.redline /tmp/demo.bak --physical
```

## SQLite parity test coverage

The default SQLite-visible contract is documented in [docs/sqlite-parity.md](docs/sqlite-parity.md).

RedlineDB currently ships **300+ SQL-focused SQLite parity tests** across
dedicated oracle, surface, and negative-boundary suites, plus the
`parity_oracle` corpus under `crates/sql/tests/parity_corpus/`. The high-level
status is:

| Suite | Tests | Role |
|---|---:|---|
| `crates/sql/tests/parity_agg_funcs.rs` | 17 | SQLite aggregate and JSON aggregate behavior |
| `crates/sql/tests/parity_coverage.rs` | 29 | Positive SQL constructs: ALTER, DROP INDEX, RETURNING, subqueries, NULL behavior, PRAGMAs, savepoints, joins |
| `crates/sql/tests/parity_negative.rs` | 24 | Explicit error boundaries for unsupported SQL so gaps do not silently mis-execute |
| `crates/sql/tests/parity_scalar_funcs.rs` | 44 | SQLite scalar functions including `substr`, `trim`, `instr`, `replace`, `printf`, `iif`, `char`, `unicode`, blobs |
| `crates/sql/tests/parity_{cte,compound_select,window,view,trigger,attach,fk_enforce,json1,json_table,partial_index,expr_index,generated_col,operators}.rs` | 140+ | Focused rusqlite-oracle parity for implemented SQLite SQL surfaces |
| `crates/sql/tests/differential_lab.rs` | 4 | Live row-for-row differential matrices against bundled `rusqlite` |
| `crates/sql/tests/sqlite_full_parity.rs` | 3 | Reference-build metadata, representative differential coverage, and full-parity sentinels |
| `crates/sql/tests/parity_oracle.rs` | 58 | Full corpus gate across 55 SQL files plus harness self-tests |

> **Current local proof:** `rtk cargo test -p redlinedb-sql --test parity_agg_funcs --test parity_coverage --test parity_negative --test parity_scalar_funcs --test differential_lab --test sqlite_full_parity --quiet --locked`

The parity suites have **0 ignored tests**. RedlineDB is still **not full
SQLite**: native SQLite file-format compatibility, rollback-journal/WAL byte
compatibility, full reference-build PRAGMA coverage, collation completeness,
natural joins, cross-database writes, and some ALTER/UPSERT/view/trigger/CLI
edge cases remain tracked as `partial`, `fail`, `not-started`, or
`rejects-by-design` in [docs/sqlite-parity.md](docs/sqlite-parity.md). CTEs,
compound SELECT, window functions, views, triggers, generated columns,
partial/expression indexes, foreign keys, ATTACH/DETACH read paths, JSON1, and
the covered `sqlite3_*` ABI surface are no longer listed as unstarted gaps.

---

## Reproducing the benchmarks

The full xbabe1 certification at the headline thread/workload/durability sweep took **~58 minutes wall-clock on a 128-core host**. A small subset (smoke, ~1 min) reproduces locally:

```bash
# Local smoke: 4 workloads × 2 thread levels × 1 rep + 1 warmup
cargo run -p redlinedb-bench --release -- certify \
  --config crates/bench/bench/smoke.toml \
  --out-dir target/bench/certify-smoke \
  --seed 7 --repetitions 1 --warmup 1

# SQL compat (40 cases)
cargo run -p redlinedb-bench --release -- compat \
  --engine both --test-dir crates/bench/compat \
  --seed 7 --out target/bench/compat.json

# Recovery matrix (36 cases)
cargo run -p redlinedb-bench --release -- recover-matrix \
  --config crates/bench/bench/recovery-matrix.toml \
  --out target/bench/recovery.json --seed 7

# Failpoint matrix (24 cases, zero-lost-acked-commits gate)
cargo run -p redlinedb-bench --release -- failpoint-matrix \
  --config crates/bench/bench/failpoint-matrix.toml \
  --out target/bench/failpoint.json --seed 7

# Remote (xbabe1) full certification
./scripts/bench/xbabe1_sync.sh
./scripts/bench/xbabe1_run.sh cargo run -p redlinedb-bench --release -- certify \
  --config crates/bench/bench/certification.toml \
  --out-dir target/bench/xbabe1/certification \
  --seed 7 --repetitions 5 --warmup 1
./scripts/bench/xbabe1_fetch.sh certification

# Regenerate paper figures from the cert artifacts
python3 paper/scripts/build_figs.py
```

Every certification run emits a manifest with the git SHA, Docker image digest, host CPU/RAM/FS fingerprint, validated SQLite PRAGMAs, per-cell SHA-256 checksums, and `process_metrics_per_run` (RSS, fdatasync count, pwrite count, ctx switches). Two runs with the same git SHA + image digest + seed are byte-comparable.

---

## Status

RedlineDB is **Phase 9 fused and certified**. Tag history (most recent first):

| Tag | What landed |
|---|---|
| `paper-v1` | 10-page IEEE conference paper (this repo's `paper/main.pdf`) |
| `phase9-xbabe1-certified` | Full 1728-child cert on xbabe1, 0 failures |
| `wave7-fused` / `phase9-fusion-green-v3` | Reviewer pass-2: parallel scheduler, commit-failure rollback, real failpoint gating |
| `wave6-fused` / `phase9-fusion-green-v2` | Reviewer pass-1: B-tree split for duplicate keys, index undo log, ack-log fsync, BUSY/LOCKED/timeout split |
| `wave5-fused` | Failpoint hooks + matrix subcommand + child oracle |
| `wave4-fused` | SQL planner / executor index reads (IndexPointLookup, IndexRangeScan) |
| `wave3-fused` | SQL DML index maintenance with NULL parity + INSERT OR REPLACE/IGNORE |
| `wave2-fused` | BtreeIndex transactional lifecycle + Lsn sentinel cleanup |
| `wave1-fused` | Failpoint infrastructure, bench telemetry, Docker / proof-lane hygiene |
| `phase9-baseline` | Six-commit subsystem split of phase-8 WIP |

The tags are checkpoints, not promises — the only durable claim is the proof in `docs/WORKPLAN_slam.md` and the artifacts under `target/bench/`.

## Limitations and roadmap

We try to publish RedlineDB's wins and its trailing edges with equal weight. As of `paper-v1`:

- **Single-row hot contention** (e.g., `hot-row-update`) is roughly 5× slower than SQLite. SQLite's WAL writer batches small commits in a way our group-commit path does not yet match. Improving this is a 2026 lane.
- **Large secondary-index range scans** are the biggest gap. The B-tree range cursor is correct but lacks prefetch and warm-leaf reuse. SQLite wins ~80× at 64 threads on `secondary-index-range`. Range-cursor prefetch is a planned kernel lane.
- **Single-thread, per-tx overhead** is higher than SQLite's. The MVCC version-chain bookkeeping and durable rowid B-tree pay off as concurrency rises but cost a constant tax at thread count = 1.
- **`sqlite3_*` ABI shim** now covers the documented symbol set enforced by
  `crates/ffi/tests/symbol_diff.rs`; any deliberately excluded symbols stay in
  the allowlist instead of being counted as SQL parity passes. The shim is a
  Rust crate (`crates/ffi`), not a separate C codebase.
- **No encryption-at-rest yet.** Pages and WAL are checksummed but not encrypted. Tracked as a Phase 10 deliverable.
- **Serializable isolation** is not yet supported; we run snapshot isolation. SSI (Cahill-style) is on the future-work list.

---

## Contributing

Bug reports and patches are welcome. The proof discipline in this repo is unusually strict for a hobby database:

- Every change runs `cargo fmt --check`, `./scripts/check_file_sizes.sh`, `cargo check --workspace --locked`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace --locked`.
- Active source files stay under 2,000 LOC (`.jankurai/file-size-policy.toml`).
- New `unsafe` blocks outside `crates/ffi` go into `.jankurai/unsafe-ledger.toml` with reviewer sign-off.
- Bench claims must come with a manifest (`target/bench/.../manifest.json`) carrying the git SHA, image digest, host fingerprint, and per-artifact SHA-256.
- The proof ledger in `docs/WORKPLAN_slam.md` is the source of truth for any performance number quoted.
- Enable the repo-managed Git hooks with `git config core.hooksPath tools/jankurai-hooks` so the tracked pre-commit hook can block stale branches before commit.

See `AGENTS.md` for the agent routing protocol used during multi-stream development.
